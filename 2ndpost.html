                    Tablets exist in a space between phones and laptops that is becoming increasingly muddled. As phones become more powerful and gain larger displays, laptops continue to get lighter. Tablet manufacturers haven’t been resting on their laurels, though, and many of the more recent tablets we’ve seen are looking to bridge the gap in terms of performance and, in select cases, handle some tasks more efficiently than both phones and laptops.

                    The tablet spectrum is varied, too. Inexpensive models like the Amazon Fire HD 10 make for excellent media streaming devices, while those in Microsoft’s versatile Surface lineup can easily serve as ad-hoc laptops when paired with an optional, folio-style keyboard. Then there’s the ubiquitous iPad, a slate that has become the go-to tablet for anyone searching for something in the Apple ecosystem (and for many outside of it).

                    Below, we’ve rounded up deals for a number of Android, iPadOS, and Windows tablets. We’ve also broken down the deals by manufacturer to make things easier, and we will continue to update this post regularly as new discounts and sales become available.

                    The recent announcement of a new iPad Air has led Apple to significantly discount its last-gen predecessor, the 2020 iPad Air. The older model may lack Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip, but its A14 Bionic processor is still capable of delivering plenty of power and should be fast enough for the vast majority of apps. The tablet is also compatible with various iPad Air accessories, which allow you to transform it into an ad-hoc laptop using add-ons like Apple’s Magic Keyboard. The 10.9-inch tablet offers a terrific Retina display with 2360 x 1640 and a wide color gamut as well, not to mention a USB-C port for charging. Normally $599, the 64GB, Wi-Fi-equipped iPad Air is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy right now for $499.99,

                    In many ways, the iPad Pro is the scaled-up model of the most recent iPad Air. The 12.9-inch Pro features Apple’s M1 chip, the same all-aluminum form factor, and the option for 5G connectivity. The 12-inch iPad Pro includes a larger, Mini LED display, though, along with a superior camera array, support for Face ID, and a variable refresh rate.
